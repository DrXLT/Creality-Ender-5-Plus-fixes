These filament sensors have an elongated screw mount to adjust and slightly preload the spring roller switch.
As always, the functional quality is dependent on the print quality of the filament guide and the accuracy of installing the originally provided switch.

These are improvements over the original upgrade that came with my Ender 5 Plus as the original sensor case would jam instead of letting filament through because the filament would strike the roller at the wrong place and keep filament from feeding through, despite repeated attempts. There are several types of the cases here, two that are similar to the original, and one that uses minimal printing material and does not hide the switch. The two original style have opposite feed directions, the origianl direction being the 'long' one.

Hope these help someone.
